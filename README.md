# General information about this
The project is a learning project, for me to get familiar with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The deployed frontend webpage is available at: [MartInsta](https://martinsta.netlify.app/)

The deployed app is only for showcase, it contains frontend features, without the backend. This means after the first F5, all the data will be lost. Also there is no authentication and authorization.

# Features

* User profile page, where you only see your uploaded pictures
